    "**Vehicle Detection Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals / steps of this project are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier\n",
    "* Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. \n",
    "* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.\n",
    "* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.\n",
    "* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.\n",
    "* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.\n",

    "## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/513/view) Points\n",
    "### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Writeup / README\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf. \n",

    "### Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Explain how (and identify where in your code) you extracted HOG features from the training images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this step is contained in the fifth code cell of the IPython notebook into the function `extract_features`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to be able to execute this step it is necessary to load all the vehicle and non-vehicles images. This is done in the second cell. Here is an example of one of each of the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image1]\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to use the same parameters as in the lesson, except for the number of orientations. This number is now equal to 6 which contributes to cut down the processing time. I grabbed random images from each of the two classes and displayed them to get a feel for what the `skimage.hog()` output looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example using the `YCrCb` color space and HOG parameters of `orientations=6`, `pixels_per_cell=(8, 8)` and `cells_per_block=(2, 2)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image2]\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image3]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Explain how you settled on your final choice of HOG parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried various combinations of parameters and I decided to use those defined in cell 6, which in the case of the hog_features are very similar to those used in the lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you trained a classifier using your selected HOG features (and color features if you used them).\n",
    "\n",
    "I trained a rbf SVM (cell 15) combining HOG, bin spatial and color features in order to achieve a good accuracy. On the other hand, the chosen values for the parameters C and gamma are based on previous works. The features are extracted in cell 11, and then scaled in cell 12. The result cen be seen below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image4]\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy achieved by this classifier is 0.999149418769 (see cell 16).\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the bin spatial features, I reduced the size of the original image from (64,64) to (16,16) as you can see below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image5]\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the color features, I computed the histogram of each color channel with 64 bins and then I stacked these three feature vector into one feature vector. Here, you can see the histograms for each channel for color space `YCrCb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image6]\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be observed that for Cr and Cb channels the histogram of non-vehicle images has a lot more peaks than the histogram for vehicle images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sliding Window Search\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a sliding window search.  How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to search random window positions at random scales all over the image and came up with this (ok just kidding I didn't actually ;):\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image3]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Show some examples of test images to demonstrate how your pipeline is working.  What did you do to optimize the performance of your classifier?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately I searched on two scales using YCrCb 3-channel HOG features plus spatially binned color and histograms of color in the feature vector, which provided a nice result.  Here are some example images:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image4]\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Video Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (somewhat wobbly or unstable bounding boxes are ok as long as you are identifying the vehicles most of the time with minimal false positives.)\n",
    "Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video.mp4)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented some kind of filter for false positives and some method for combining overlapping bounding boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I recorded the positions of positive detections in each frame of the video.  From the positive detections I created a heatmap and then thresholded that map to identify vehicle positions.  I then used `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` to identify individual blobs in the heatmap.  I then assumed each blob corresponded to a vehicle.  I constructed bounding boxes to cover the area of each blob detected.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example result showing the heatmap from a series of frames of video, the result of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` and the bounding boxes then overlaid on the last frame of video:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here are six frames and their corresponding heatmaps:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image5]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here is the output of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` on the integrated heatmap from all six frames:\n",
    "![alt text][image6]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here the resulting bounding boxes are drawn onto the last frame in the series:\n",
    "![alt text][image7]\n",

    "\n",
    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.  \n",
